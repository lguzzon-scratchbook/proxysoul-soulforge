const SOUL_MAP_DESCRIPTION = `This is the Soul Map — a live structural view of the entire codebase, rebuilt after every edit.
It is ranked by importance, so the highest-impact files surface first.

What each part means:
- Files are ranked by importance (highest-impact files first)
- (→N) after a file = blast radius — N other files depend on it
- + before a symbol = exported (part of the public API)
- ← arrows = "imported by" — shows which files depend on this one
- Signatures show function/type shapes so you can understand APIs without reading files
- Key dependencies section shows external packages and how widely they're used`;

const SOUL_MAP_USAGE = `This map is a ranked, truncated index — an orientation layer, not the codebase. It surfaces the highest-impact files and exports; lower-ranked symbols, bodies, and whole files are cut (see "+N more", "... (N more)"). Use it to locate, not to conclude.

- "Where is X?" → the map points you at a file + line to confirm with a read/navigate.
- "What does Y export?" → a starting list; verify before asserting the full surface.
- "What depends on Z?" → (→N) and ← arrows orient blast radius; soul_impact confirms it.

Absence from the map is NOT absence from the codebase — a missing symbol may be ranked out, not nonexistent. Before stating any claim about how the code behaves, confirm it with a soul tool (soul_grep() / soul_find() / navigate() / read()). The map tells you where to look; the tools tell you what's true. Reason from the snapshot, answer from the tools.`;
